I used Claude to help me create an app and deploy it.  The app allows multiple users of multiple games (competitions) to
to keep track of any game competition with a running score. Multiple trackers can run simultaneously.
An admin initializes the game and a code is generated for other users to join the Tracker.
Any user can update a score while seeing who is winning at the bottom of the screen.
The History of changes shows 1. who won the game, 2. who is winning the game or if its tied,
3. Who updated the score, and 4. if the Admin did an Undue of the last action or reset the
score.  By allowing any user to update the score, the app allows full engagement of all users,
while also maintaining control of the scoring by the Admin, just in case someone tries to cheat
or in case multiple users updated the same game.  All users can see who updated the last score.
This tracking app is a simple way for game players who play a game over a long period of time
to keep track of who is winning over that time frame.
