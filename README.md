This project involved creating an html file from Claude.ai with a prompt in order to create an app that allows two specific users 
the ability to keep track of a running score for two card games, Rummy and Casino.  I envisioned this app because my girlfriend
and I play both of these games and have done so for at least two years, and I wondered who has won more games.  For now, the app
only allows each of us to enter a score and the scores are not synched.  For example, when I enter a score from my computer, and she
enters one from her's, the scores are not synced up.  This is because there is no backend database.  The next version, which I am
working on now, will have a backend database so that the score is synced and whenever either of us launches the app from our 
separate computers, we'll both see the running score.  The app also allows to reset the score back to zero and also has an Undue 
function to correct any past mistakes.  My next project after this will be to create the game, Casino, as a multi-user interactive
game.  There aren't any online games like this for Casino, so I'm excited to try to create one.
